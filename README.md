🍰 WebStudio Landing Page

Hi! This is a frontend training project I built in my free time.

It’s a fully responsive landing page based on a Figma design. I created it to sharpen my HTML, CSS, and responsive layout skills.

🚀 What I Learned

This project helped me improve my frontend fundamentals — especially in building responsive layouts and organizing clean, scalable code.

Even though there were no major challenges, it was great practice for real-world layout structure and styling.

✨ What's Next?

I don’t have specific plans for updates yet, but I might experiment with animations or additional interactivity in the future.
